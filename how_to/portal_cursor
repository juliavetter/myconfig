Problem: when opening KDE portal from Firefox (or other KDE/Qt application)
the cursor icons change

Solution (on Ubuntu): edit the file /usr/share/icons/default/index.theme
to contain the following:

[Icon Theme]
Name=Breeze
Inherits=DMZ-Black

(DMZ-Black looks similar enough to the Adwaita theme)
